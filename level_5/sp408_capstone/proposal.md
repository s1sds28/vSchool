Hi Roy, below is my capstone proposal. I wanted to send it to you because it looks like I'm scheduled with you for the level 5 final:

# Proposal

## App Idea

This app will meet the requirements for vSchool's level 5 Capstone Project. The app will help you keep track of all your bills and if you paid them.

- The back-end:
    - Built with Express, Mongoose, and Morgan dependencies.
    - Create models and API (Possibly connect with Google Calendar if time permits).
    - Mongoose model to store the bills in a MongoDB database.

- The front-end:
  - A home page to show how to use the app.
  - A page to input all your bills (phone, car, and rent).
  - A page to view all your bills and check if you paid them.

## User Story
**Type of user:** A person that wants to track all their bills (It's difficult to remember when bills are due and if they have been paid).
**Goal:** To quickly check when a bill is due and if it has already been paid.
**Reason:** I have bills due on a monthly, quarterly, and semiannual basis. It's hard to remember what bills have been paid and if they have been invoiced correctly.

## MVP
- Home page to explain the app.
- One page to add bills.
- One page to view and check paid.
